# Arcade-Game

This is a clone of the pong game. It has additional obstacles like gravity fields and break out walls. I made this for a school project with my classmate Ryan Kersh. The purpose of the project was to learn more about python and organize the code into a model view controller architectural pattern. To play the game, run the main file. Keep the model, view and controller files in the same folder as main. This is written in python and uses numpy and Tkinter.
