# Arcade-Game

This is a clone of the pong game. It has additional obstacles like gravity fields and break out walls. I made this for a school project with my classmate Ryan Kersh. The purpose of the project was to learn more about python and organize the code into a model view controller architectural pattern. To play the game, run the main file. Keep the model, view and controller files in the same folder as main. This is written in python and uses numpy and Tkinter.

Soon to come! - Online Version

I have another pong clone with a server and two clients. The server maintains the game model and the two clients display the game and take user input. In the end, I want the game to be played by two players from separate computers. So far, I just have an example that runs all three applications on my desktop and uses tcp sockets to communicate. I hope to improve this as I learn more about sockets and using the python socket library.
